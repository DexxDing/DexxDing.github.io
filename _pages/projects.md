### Honours Project, *Mar 2024 - Oct 2024*
- **Supervisour:** Dr. Lei Wang
- **Topic:** Advancing Multi-modal Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection
- **Project:** Overview: We proposed a novel graph-based multi-modal fusion operator that applies on video
anomaly detection, testing its effectiveness across diverse modalities, representations, and domains. The proposed
method demonstrated efficiency and performance improvements over existing fusion techniques on popular video
anomaly detection datasets, highlighting its potential for advancing VAD applications.
